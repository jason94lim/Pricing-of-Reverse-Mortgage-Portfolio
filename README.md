# Pricing-of-Reverse-Mortgage-Portfolio
This repository is my final year project (FYP) where I have completed this project with another 4 group members. The purpose of this project is to determine the value of reverse mortgage portfolio given using various actuarial techniques. 

What is reverse mortgage portfolio?

A reverse mortgage is a type of home loan that allows you to borrow money using the equity in your home as security. The loan can be taken as a lump sum, a regular income stream, a line of credit or a combination of these options.

Interest is charged like any other loan, except you don't have to make repayments while you live in your home - the interest compounds over time and is added to your loan balance. You remain the owner of your house and can stay in it for as long as you want.

You must repay the loan in full (including interest and fees) when you sell your home or die or, in most cases, if you move into aged care.

While no income is required to qualify, credit providers are required by law to lend you money responsibly, so not everyone will be able to obtain this type of loan.

All valuations were done using the following raw data:

1. Quarterly property indices of Australian properties across Sydeny, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Canberra.
2. Reverse mortgage borrower's data 
3. Australian male and female population data (Used to calculate the mortality rates of Australian residents)
